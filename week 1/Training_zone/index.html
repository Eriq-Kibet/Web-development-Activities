      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Training Zone have been the leader in all kinds of training that covers

        Training Zone. Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the
        world-famous LectureClash training:
        <br />
        Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they
        can be manageable. Here aresome thoughts on how to deal with it:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.</li>
          <li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's notenough).</li>
          <li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that'snot on the web.</li>
          <li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:
            <ul><li>
              If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3that's 33%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Which one are you most on top of?
            </li> 
            <li>
              Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'dbe no point to lectures.
          </li>
        </ul>
