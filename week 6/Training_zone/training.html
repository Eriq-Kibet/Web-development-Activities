      <h4>Management File - What IS The Point Of Performance Appraisal</h4>
      <h5>By Robert Bacal, M.A</h5>

        by phone at (204) 888-9290. Probably the most misused and abused and
        disused management tool in history is the performanceappraisal. It's the
        strangest thing. Ask any manager or human resources person whether they
        thinkperformance appraisal is an important thing to do, they are almost
        unanimous. "Of course, it is", is thecommon response. If you ask why
        it's important, they will tell you and tell you and tell you.The odd
        thing is that they often don't get done, and managers, supervisors and
        employees hate thedarned things. Human resource professionals spend a
        lot of time whipping people into doing them,while managers look for a
        variety of reasons to delay and delay. Why is that?It's uncomfortable to
        do performance appraisals. But why is it uncomfortable? Because
        peopleundertake them for the wrong reasons and wrong perspective, which
        ends up putting the manager andthe employee on different "sides".
        Appraisals are used for determining pay increases, who gets let go,who
        gets promoted. Often, they are used to focus on what people have done
        wrong.So, what is the point of performance appraisals? Here's a starting
        point that actually works.
        <b
          >The most important purpose or goal of the appraisal is to improve
          performance in the future</b
        >...and not just forthe employee. Managers can get valuable information
        from employees to help them make employee'sjobs more productive. Work
        units and organizations can identify problems that interfere
        witheveryone's work.If we shift from affixing blame, to identifying
        barriers to performance we begin to remove the fear anddread people have
        about these "appraisals". When we focus on the present and the future,
        we changeour focus to what's been to what can be better tomorrow. An
        appraisal that works involves a number of things, but first and foremost
        is the process of identifyingwhat has gotten in the way of better
        performance (regardless of the level of performance), and howmanager and
        employee can work together in the future, to improve it. It's really
        that simple.When managers put away the "blaming stick" in appraisals and
        move to a cooperative, dialogueapproach, the whole process can become
        more comfortable and effective. Because it puts themanager and employee
        on the same side, and working towards the same goals, getting better
        andbetter.Sure, we do use appraisals for a number of reasons but if we
        are going to get real value out of the timeand energy we put into them,
        we have to look at the process in a more constructive way. And,
        bottomline, that's making performance better.
