        management and IT in Plongk St,Cairsville for the last 150 years. The
        founder of the company, Terrence Zonas is still CEO andspokesperson for
        Training Zone. Here is one of his first ever training lessons, the
        <span class="action">world-famous Lecture Clash training: </span>        
        <br />
        Anyone got a lecture clash? They're not pretty, but with your help, they
        can be manageable. Here aresome thoughts on how to deal with it:
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Realise that it's up to you. You are responsible for making it work.</li>
          <li>Attend one lecture and get the notes from the other (start with the web notes, but that's notenough).</li>
          <li>Find a friend in the one you miss and get them to tell you what else was covered in class that'snot on the web.</li>
          <li>Which one do you miss? - Some ideas to help you with that decision are:
            <ul><li>
              If you miss one out of two lectures for a subject, that's 50%. If you miss one out of 3that's 33%.
            </li>
            <li>
              Which one are you most on top of?
            </li> 
            <li>
              Which subject has the most complete lecture notes?
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't ask your lecturer - "did I miss anything in the lecture?" If you didn't miss anything, there'dbe no point to lectures.
          </li>
        </ul>
